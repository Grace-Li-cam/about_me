# About Me

10+ years of extensive experiences in the roles of content strategist, writer, editor, technical support, and even software developer. 

I am able to take my programming skills and apply them to content design and writing, putting myself in a position where I feel I'd be valuable in both a hands-on capacity and in a position where lucid, straight forward content are needed for a variety of audiences.

Now, I am keen on developing content strategies to engage key audiences and creating story-driven content to tie to the experiences calls for.

I am passionate about writing. Over 8+ years of experience creating easy-to-understand content and writing and editing high-quality technical publications that build effective interactions between authors, readers, and the technical information that bridges them.
